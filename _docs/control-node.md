<code>ASControlNode</code> is the ASDK equivalent to <code>UIControl</code>.  You don't create instances of <code>ASControlNode</code> directly.  Instead, you can use it as a subclassing point when creating controls of your own.  In fact, <a href = "/docs/text-node.html">ASTextNode</a>, <a href = "/docs/image-node.html">ASImageNode</a>, <a href = "/docs/video-node.html">ASVideoNode</a> and <a href = "/docs/map-node.html">ASMapNode</a> are all subclasses of <code>ASControlNode</code>.

This fact is especially useful when it comes to image and text nodes.  Having the ability to add target-action pairs means that you can use any text or image node as a button without having to rely on creating gesture recognizers, as you would with text in UIKit, or creating extraneous views as you might when using <code>UIButton</code>.

### Control State

Like <code>UIControl</code>, <code>ASControlNode</code> has a state which defines its appearance and ability to support user interactions.  Its state can be one of any state defined by <code>ASControlState</code>.

<div class = "highlight-group">
<span class="language-toggle"><a data-lang="swift" class="swiftButton">Swift</a><a data-lang="objective-c" class = "active objcButton">Objective-C</a></span>
<div class = "code">
<pre lang="objc" class="objcCode">
typedef NS_OPTIONS(NSUInteger, ASControlState) {
    ASControlStateNormal       = 0,
    ASControlStateHighlighted  = 1 << 0,  // used when isHighlighted is set
    ASControlStateDisabled     = 1 << 1,
    ASControlStateSelected     = 1 << 2,  // used when isSelected is set
    ...
};
</pre>
<pre lang="swift" class = "swiftCode hidden">
public struct ASControlState : OptionSet {
    public static var highlighted: ASControlState { get } // used when ASControlNode isHighlighted is set
    public static var disabled: ASControlState { get }
    public static var selected: ASControlState { get } // used when ASControlNode isSelected is set
    public static var reserved: ASControlState { get } // flags reserved for internal framework use
}
</pre>
</div>
</div>

### Target-Action Mechanism

Also similarly to <code>UIControl</code>, <code>ASControlNode</code>'s have a set of events defined which you can react to by assigning a target-action pair.  

The available actions are: 
<div class = "highlight-group">
<span class="language-toggle"><a data-lang="swift" class="swiftButton">Swift</a><a data-lang="objective-c" class = "active objcButton">Objective-C</a></span>
<div class = "code">
  <pre lang="objc" class="objcCode">
typedef NS_OPTIONS(NSUInteger, ASControlNodeEvent)
{
  /** A touch-down event in the control node. */
  ASControlNodeEventTouchDown         = 1 << 0,
  /** A repeated touch-down event in the control node; for this event the value of the UITouch tapCount method is greater than one. */
  ASControlNodeEventTouchDownRepeat   = 1 << 1,
  /** An event where a finger is dragged inside the bounds of the control node. */
  ASControlNodeEventTouchDragInside   = 1 << 2,
  /** An event where a finger is dragged just outside the bounds of the control. */
  ASControlNodeEventTouchDragOutside  = 1 << 3,
  /** A touch-up event in the control node where the finger is inside the bounds of the node. */
  ASControlNodeEventTouchUpInside     = 1 << 4,
  /** A touch-up event in the control node where the finger is outside the bounds of the node. */
  ASControlNodeEventTouchUpOutside    = 1 << 5,
  /** A system event canceling the current touches for the control node. */
  ASControlNodeEventTouchCancel       = 1 << 6,
  /** All events, including system events. */
  ASControlNodeEventAllEvents         = 0xFFFFFFFF
};
</pre>
<pre lang="swift" class = "swiftCode hidden">
public struct ASControlNodeEvent : OptionSet {
    /** A touch-down event in the control node. */
    public static var touchDown: ASControlNodeEvent { get }
    /** A repeated touch-down event in the control node; for this event the value of the UITouch tapCount method is greater than one. */
    public static var touchDownRepeat: ASControlNodeEvent { get }
    /** An event where a finger is dragged inside the bounds of the control node. */
    public static var touchDragInside: ASControlNodeEvent { get }
    /** An event where a finger is dragged just outside the bounds of the control. */
    public static var touchDragOutside: ASControlNodeEvent { get }
    /** A touch-up event in the control node where the finger is inside the bounds of the node. */
    public static var touchUpInside: ASControlNodeEvent { get }
    /** A touch-up event in the control node where the finger is outside the bounds of the node. */
    public static var touchUpOutside: ASControlNodeEvent { get }
    /** A system event canceling the current touches for the control node. */
    public static var touchCancel: ASControlNodeEvent { get }
    /** A system event when the Play/Pause button on the Apple TV remote is pressed. */
    public static var primaryActionTriggered: ASControlNodeEvent { get }
    /** All events, including system events. */
    public static var allEvents: ASControlNodeEvent { get }
}
</pre>
</div>
</div>

Assigning a target and action for these events is done with the same methods as a <code>UIControl</code>, namely using <code>â€“addTarget:action:forControlEvents:</code>.

### Hit Test Slop

While all node's have a <code>hitTestSlop</code> property, this is usually most useful when dealing with controls.  Instead of needing to make your control bigger, or needing to override <code>-hitTest:withEvent:</code> you can just assign a <code>UIEdgeInsets</code> to your control and its boundaries will be expanded accordingly.

<div class = "highlight-group">
<span class="language-toggle"><a data-lang="swift" class="swiftButton">Swift</a><a data-lang="objective-c" class = "active objcButton">Objective-C</a></span>
<div class = "code">
  <pre lang="objc" class="objcCode">
CGFloat horizontalDiff = (bounds.size.width - _playButton.bounds.size.width)/2;
CGFloat verticalDiff = (bounds.size.height - _playButton.bounds.size.height)/2;

_playButton.hitTestSlop = UIEdgeInsetsMake(-verticalDiff, -horizontalDiff, -verticalDiff, -horizontalDiff);
</pre>
<pre lang="swift" class = "swiftCode hidden">
let horizontalDiff = (bounds.size.width - playButton.bounds.size.width) / 2
let verticalDiff = (bounds.size.height - playButton.bounds.size.height) / 2

playButton.hitTestSlop = UIEdgeInsets(top: -verticalDiff, left: -horizontalDiff, bottom: -verticalDiff, right: -horizontalDiff)
</pre>
</div>
</div>

Remember that, since the property is an inset, you'll need to use negative values in order to expand the size of your tappable region.

### Hit Test Visualization

The <a href = "/docs/debug-tool-hit-test-visualization.html">hit test visualization tool</a> is an option to enable highlighting of the tappable areas of your nodes.  To enable it, include <code>[ASControlNode setEnableHitTestDebug:YES]</code> in your app delegate in <code>-application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:</code>.
